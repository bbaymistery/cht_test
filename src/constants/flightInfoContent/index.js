 Please allow enough time to clear immigration and baggage reclaim,
 Our driver will be waiting for you in the arrivals hall, with an “Airport Pickups” name board with your name on it.
 They will then accompany you to the vehicle.

  If you realise that you will not be able to meet the driver within the 30 minutes,
  then if you contact us, we will hold the driver in the terminal
  for an extra at a charge of £10.00 for the first 15 minutes and then £5 for every extra 15 minutes waited.
  If you are still not out within this time then the driver will be pulled off and the job will be registered as a no show.

   For example, if your flight lands at 10:00 am, and you have requested your pickup time to be 60 mins after the flight landing time;
   our driver will be in the terminal at 11 am. The driver will wait till 11:30 am FREE of charge. After this time,
   if requested, the driver will wait an additional 30 mins
   chargeable at £10.00 for the first 15 minutes and then £5 for every additional 15 minutes
